Technical Specification: AI Personal Finance Chatbot
1. Project Overview
This document outlines the technical specifications for a web-based personal finance chatbot. The application will allow users to track their income and expenses through a conversational interface, view their financial data on a dashboard, and receive AI-driven suggestions for asset management.


2. Technology Stack
Framework: Next.js
UI Components: shadcn/ui
Database & Backend: Supabase
Authentication: Clerk
AI & Chat: Vercel AI SDK


3. Core Features
3.1. Conversational Financial Logging 💬
Users can input their financial activities using natural language. The chatbot will parse the input to identify and record transactions.

Examples: "I spent $15 on lunch," "got paid my $2500 salary today," "put 50 dollars into my savings."
Functionality: The AI will extract key details like amount, type (income/expense), category, and date.
3.2. Financial Dashboard 📊
A dedicated page that provides a clear, visual summary of the user's financial status.

Components:
Income vs. Expense breakdown (e.g., pie chart, bar graph).
Spending by category.
Net worth summary over time.
A list or table of recent transactions.
3.3. Secure User Authentication 🔐
User registration and login will be handled by Clerk, ensuring a secure and seamless onboarding experience. Each user's data will be isolated and private.
3.4. AI-Powered Insights & Suggestions💡
The application will provide proactive advice to help users improve their financial health.

Functionality: Based on spending habits and income, the AI can suggest budget adjustments, savings strategies, or potential investment opportunities for asset development.


4. Application & Data Flow
The user journey and data interaction are designed to be simple and intuitive.

Authentication:

A new user signs up or an existing user logs in via the Clerk authentication modal.
Upon successful authentication, Clerk provides a user session and a unique userId.

Chat Interaction (Data Input):

The user types a financial activity into the chat interface on the Next.js frontend.
The frontend sends this user prompt to a server-side API route, including the authentication token from Clerk.
This API route uses the Vercel AI SDK to process the natural language. The AI model identifies the intent (e.g., logging an expense) and extracts entities (amount, category, description).
The API route then structures this information into a JSON object.
This structured data, along with the userId extracted from the JWT, is sent to Supabase to be inserted as a new record in the transactions table.
The chatbot interface updates to confirm the transaction has been logged.

Dashboard Visualization (Data Retrieval):

The user navigates to the /dashboard page.
The Next.js page component makes a server-side request to Supabase. The user's JWT is passed along, allowing Supabase's RLS policies to automatically filter the data.
The fetched data is used to render the charts and summaries built with shadcn/ui and a charting library (e.g., Recharts).


5. Database Schema (Supabase/PostgreSQL) with Clerk Auth
The database schema is designed to work with Clerk as the authentication provider. The user_id in each table will be a TEXT field, corresponding to the user ID supplied by Clerk in the JWT.

Row-Level Security (RLS) policies will be enforced to ensure users can only access their own data by checking the sub (subject) claim in the JWT against the user_id in the table.
transactions
Stores all income and expense events.

CREATE TABLE transactions (

  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),

  user_id TEXT NOT NULL, -- Clerk User ID

  amount NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL,

  type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'income' or 'expense'

  category_id INT REFERENCES categories(id),

  description TEXT,

  transaction_date TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),

  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Enable RLS

ALTER TABLE transactions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- RLS Policies for transactions

CREATE POLICY "User can view their own transactions"

ON transactions FOR SELECT TO authenticated

USING (((select auth.jwt()->>'sub') = user_id));

CREATE POLICY "User can insert their own transactions"

ON transactions FOR INSERT TO authenticated

WITH CHECK (((select auth.jwt()->>'sub') = user_id));

CREATE POLICY "User can update their own transactions"

ON transactions FOR UPDATE TO authenticated

USING (((select auth.jwt()->>'sub') = user_id));

CREATE POLICY "User can delete their own transactions"

ON transactions FOR DELETE TO authenticated

USING (((select auth.jwt()->>'sub') = user_id));
categories
Stores user-defined transaction categories.

CREATE TABLE categories (

  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

  user_id TEXT NOT NULL, -- Clerk User ID

  name TEXT NOT NULL,

  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),

  UNIQUE(user_id, name) -- A user cannot have duplicate category names

);

-- Enable RLS

ALTER TABLE categories ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- RLS Policies for categories

CREATE POLICY "User can view their own categories"

ON categories FOR SELECT TO authenticated

USING (((select auth.jwt()->>'sub') = user_id));

CREATE POLICY "User can insert their own categories"

ON categories FOR INSERT TO authenticated

WITH CHECK (((select auth.jwt()->>'sub') = user_id));

CREATE POLICY "User can update their own categories"

ON categories FOR UPDATE TO authenticated

USING (((select auth.jwt()->>'sub') = user_id));

CREATE POLICY "User can delete their own categories"

ON categories FOR DELETE TO authenticated

USING (((select auth.jwt()->>'sub') = user_id));
assets
Tracks user assets for financial goal planning.

CREATE TABLE assets (

  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),

  user_id TEXT NOT NULL, -- Clerk User ID

  name TEXT NOT NULL, -- e.g., 'Savings Account', 'Stock Portfolio'

  type TEXT NOT NULL, -- e.g., 'cash', 'investment', 'property'

  current_value NUMERIC(12, 2) NOT NULL,

  last_updated TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()

);

-- Enable RLS

ALTER TABLE assets ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- RLS Policies for assets

CREATE POLICY "User can view their own assets"

ON assets FOR SELECT TO authenticated

USING (((select auth.jwt()->>'sub') = user_id));

CREATE POLICY "User can insert their own assets"

ON assets FOR INSERT TO authenticated

WITH CHECK (((select auth.jwt()->>'sub') = user_id));

CREATE POLICY "User can update their own assets"

ON assets FOR UPDATE TO authenticated

USING (((select auth.jwt()->>'sub') = user_id));

CREATE POLICY "User can delete their own assets"

ON assets FOR DELETE TO authenticated

USING (((select auth.jwt()->>'sub') = user_id));
